# Unit 3
## CONTROL FLOW, FUNCTIONS

### Prerequisites:
 1. What is sequence ?
 2. What are functions?
 3. What are all the data types supported by python ?

#### Code Example 1:
```python
num1 = 3
num2 = 4
print(num1,"is Odd Number")
print(num2,"is Even Number")
```
```console 
Output ?
```

#### Code Example 2:
```python
nums = [3,4]
print(nums[0],"is Odd Number")
print(num[1],"is Even Number")
```
```console 
Output ?
```

#### Code Example 3:
What if first two numbers ware swapped ?
```python
nums = [4,3]
print(nums[0],"is Odd Number")
print(num[1],"is Even Number")
```
```console 
Output ?
```

# Flow Control

A program's control flow is the order in which the program's code executes. The control flow of a Python program is regulated by conditional statements, loops, and function calls.

## Conditional Statements
 1. Help to execute/ignore a block of code based on some conditions 
 2. It is also known as desition making statements.

### IF statement

```console
    Main Block
    if expression:
        If Block
    Main Block cont..
```

### Code Example 1:

```python
num1 = 3
if (num1%2 != 0):
    print(num2,"is Even Number")
```
```console 
Output ?
```
